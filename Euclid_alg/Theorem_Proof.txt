#This file contains the proof and theorem to Euclid's Algorithm

Theorem:
If a = bq +r, then gcd(a,b) = gcd(b,r)
    gcd(a,b) = gcd(b,r)
    gcd(b,r) = gcd(r,r1)
    gcd(r,r1) = gcd(r1,r2)
            .
            .
            .
    gcd(ri-1, ri) = gcd(ri, 0) = ri

Proof of Theorm:
Let d be any common divisor of a and b
d|a, d|b -> d|(a-bq) -> d|r

let e be any common divisor of b and r
e|b, e|r -> e|bq+r -> e|a
-> d is a common divisor of a and b iff
   d is a common divisor of b and r
